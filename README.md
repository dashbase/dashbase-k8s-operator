# dashbase-operator

This tool is currently a wrapper of [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), which allows user to create multiple kubernetes clusters in one vpc even in one subnet.

It's aim is to make user able to create a cluster like [stackpoint](https://stackpoint.io/). User only needs to do some simple selections and then can get a running cluster.
